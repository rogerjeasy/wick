# sim-alexa — the simulated Alexa+ surface

**Why this exists.** The Alexa+ MCP Toolkit is restricted to select partners with
no published application path (see `FRICTION.md` FL-001), so Wick cannot register
a real add-on. The hackathon rules explicitly permit an alternative:

> *"Alternatively, entrants may submit a simulated Alexa+ experience instead —
> built using any AI or agentic tool of their choice, no specific framework, SDK,
> or MCP-shaped surface required."*

**What this is not.** A fake Echo. The demo must never present this as a real
Alexa+ integration — doing so would be worse than not showing it at all. One line
on screen stating that the add-on surface is partner-gated and this is the
permitted alternative costs three seconds and buys credibility.

**What it does.** A small web surface that:

1. speaks to the **real** MCP server in `services/mcp-server` over Streamable
   HTTP, spec 2025-11-25 — no shortcuts, no direct database reads;
2. renders the week timeline panel that would otherwise be an MCP Apps view (M6);
3. takes a spoken or typed question and returns the Narrator's precomputed prose.

**The point.** The server is the real artefact. This is a client. If Alexa+ access
ever opens, this directory becomes redundant and **not one line of the server
changes** — which is the whole reason for building to the published spec rather
than to whatever is convenient.

Build after `services/mcp-server` answers correctly from MCP Inspector.
